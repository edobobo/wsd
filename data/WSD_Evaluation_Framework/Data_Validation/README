						WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION
				A UNIFIED EVALUATION FRAMEWORK AND EMPIRICAL COMPARISON

=================================================================================================================================


This README contains the guidelines for releasing your sense-annotated data (for either training or evaluation purposes) in a
standard unified format. 

Each dataset should of a data file in XML ("[dataset].data.xml") and a gold file in .txt ("[dataset].gold.key.txt"). In the 
original framework all the senses were annotated with WordNet 3.0 in the gold standard, but this schema may be used for other 
sense inventories and languages other than English as well. See sample "sample-dataset" for an example from the unified framework.

---Data--- 
The XML data file should contain the following tags (in this order): corpus -> text -> sentence. Then, each sentences consists 
of "wf" (non-disambiguated) and "instance" (disambiguated) tags. Both types should contain two mandatory attributes ("lemma" and
 "pos"). "instance" should additionally contain an id, which should be present in the gold file. We recommend to use Stanford 
CoreNLP pipeline for preprocessing (for the languages for which it is available). The "pos" tag (Part-of-Speech), should follow 
the Universal PoS tags (http://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/index.html). Note that it is possible to add additional attributes 
if needed (e.g. fine-grained PoS tags). See the file "schema.xsd" included in this directory for more details.

---Gold--- 
The .txt gold file should contain all the disambiguation instances included in the XML. Each line is space-separated, where the 
first column corresponds to the instance id and the remaining columns correspond to the gold key/s.

Additionally, this package includes two scripts to validate the conformity to the guidelines.

* ValidateXML.java

* ValidateGold.java

=================================================================================================================================
ValidateXML.java
=================================================================================================================================

This script verifies that the XML requirements have been followed the schema ("shchema.xsd" in this directory). See above for
more details on how to format your XML.

To use this script, you first need to compile it by typing the following command in the terminal:

	$ javac ValidateXML.java

Then, check that your dataset have followed the schema by typying: java ValidateXML XML_file schema.xsd

Example of usage:

	$ java ValidateXML sample-dataset/semeval2015.data.xml schema.xsd

If the XML file has not followed the requirements, the script will refer you to the first line in which an error was found.

=================================================================================================================================
ValidateGold.java
=================================================================================================================================

This script verifies that the ids from the gold standard and the data file do not differ. 

To use this script, you first need to compile it by typing the following command in the terminal::

	$ javac -cp "lib/*" ValidateGold.java

Then, type the following: java -cp "lib/*:." ValidateGold gold_file XML_file [wn30 candidatesWN30.txt]

Example of usage:

	$ java -cp "lib/*:." ValidateGold sample-dataset/semeval2015.data.xml sample-dataset/semeval2015.gold.key.txt

The last optional parameters ("wn30" and "candidatesWN30.txt") are applicable only when your senses are annotated with WordNet 3.0. 
The script will check that the PoS tag of the XML file and the gold file match, and will check that all gold keys are in fact 
candidate synsets from the given lemma in WordNet 3.0.

Example of usage (WordNet 3.0):

	$ java -cp "lib/*:." ValidateGold sample-dataset/semeval2015.data.xml sample-dataset/semeval2015.gold.key.txt wn30 candidatesWN30.txt

If some error was found, it will be printed in the console.
